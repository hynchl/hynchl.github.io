summary: "Game designers must provide an appropriate level of difficulty to keep players interested in the game. For this, it is necessary to identify the factors affecting the game difficulty and its causes, which may vary depending on the type of game. In this study, we examined how the target movement speed and the target location uncertainty affect the player performance in a shooting game. A successive choice reaction task, similar to a shooting game, was implemented. The target speed and target uncertainty were independently manipulated to compare the task success rate and response time by condition. The experiment design method for the within-subject factor analysis was used in which the target speed was manipulated in three levels (slow, medium, and fast) with individual staircasing, and the target uncertainty was adjusted in three steps (low, medium, high). Our results show that the task success rate increased as the target speed was slower and the target location uncertainty was lower. In addition, a significant interaction between the target speed and uncertainty was observed. In the post-hoc analysis, the effect size of target speed on the success rate increased as the target location uncertainty increased. The response time decreased as the target speed was faster and the target uncertainty was lower, and the interaction between the target speed and the target uncertainty was not significant. These results suggest that both target speed and target uncertainty affect the difficulty of a shooting game, and the two effects are not independent of each other. Thus, the level of each factor should be considered at the same time to provide the intended game difficulty. "
