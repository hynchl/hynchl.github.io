summary: "People often utilize peripheral vision to acquire visual information, without direct fixations on the target. However, the principles and strategies of using peripheral vision are much less explored and understood than those of central vision. In this study, we investigated how cognitive demand and task progress affect the utilization of peripheral vision in two controlled experiments involving visuomotor and working memory tasks. While participants performed the tasks, the nearest fixations to the target stimuli were recorded and analyzed using an eye-tracker. This was based on the assumption that the participant must acquire visual information from the target to complete the task successfully, and fixations deviated from the target potentially reflect the use of peripheral vision. The results showed that participants tended to shift their gaze less toward the target when the cognitive demand is lower or the task becomes more familiar, while the performance level was maintained or even improved. These results indicate that the utilization of peripheral vision follows the principle of cost-effective strategies."
