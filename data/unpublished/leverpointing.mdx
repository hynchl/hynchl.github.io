summary: "Raycasting is one of the most widely used techniques for 3D object selection in virtual environments. However, selecting small or distant objects using raycasting remains a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a novel VR pointing technique called LeverPointing. Inspired by the concept of leverage ratios, LeverPointing introduces a pivot point along the ray between the user and the target object, constraining the ray to rotate around this pivot. By incorporating the pivot, users control the ray's orientation through hand motion rather than wrist rotation, which is more susceptible to noise. Our technique also determines the optimal position for the pivot point in VR environments. Studies indicate that LeverPointing significantly improves accuracy in distant object selection tasks compared to traditional raycasting."
