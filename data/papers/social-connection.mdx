summary: "As virtual reality (VR) continues to evolve as a platform for gathering, collaboration, and education, new forms of communication using voice and avatars are being actively studied. However, the quantitative assessment of social experiences in VR remains a significant challenge while many qualitative methods exist. This paper investigates the behavioral indicators of perceived social experience in virtual conversations. To this end, we replicate the findings of Templeton et al., who reported that conversational gaps in face-to-face interactions predict social connection. Further, we explore whether turn-taking patterns and non-verbal behaviors predict social connection. In our experiment, 52 participants engaged in ten-minute unstructured conversations using voice and avatars, rating their social connection every 30 seconds. The results indicate that rapid response times, frequent turn-taking, longer gaze duration during a partner's turn, and higher nodding frequency predict changing social connections within VR conversations."
