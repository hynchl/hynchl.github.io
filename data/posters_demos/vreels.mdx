summary: 'Virtual reality for social interaction is increasingly studied across disciplines, from computer science to social psychology, as it enables natural communication with embodied avatars and richly interactive environments. However, developing experimental VR systems remains resource-intensive, requiring real-time communication infrastructure, multi-modal data capture capabilities, and tools for data validation and analysis. We present VREELS (Virtual Reality Environment with Embodiment for Laboratory Studies), an open-source VR framework designed to support and facilitate studies involving avatar-embodied communication. Based on a systematic review of 32 peer-reviewed studies since 2018, we identified common requirements for social VR studies. VREELS supports these scenarios with (1) built-in support for voice and avatar communication, (2) experimental control interface, (3) multimodal recording, and (4) converting to a highly compatible format for presentation, validation, and analysis. Through performance evaluation and three case studies, we demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of VREELS for synchronized multimodal data collection and scenario implementation in social VR research.'
