summary: 'Virtual reality (VR) uniquely enables the expression of nonverbal behaviors that closely resemble real-world social interactions. However, current assessments of social experience in VR rely heavily on self-report measures, limiting scalability and objectivity. To address this, I develop a social cognition model that predicts perceived social connection from behavioral data, with a focus on nonverbal dynamics such as turn-taking, gaze, and nodding. Our findings from dyadic VR conversations show that patterns of turn-taking and nonverbal behavior significantly correlate with perceived social connection. Building on this, we extend our analysis to group conversations to explore more complex interaction structures. This research contributes to computational models of social cognition, offers a scalable method for quantifying social experience, and informs the design of socially responsive agents capable of lifelike, multimodal interaction.'
