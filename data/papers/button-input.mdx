summary: "We propose a technique to quantify users' reactiveness and proactiveness in button inputs by modeling the likelihood distribution of input-output timing. Using only screen recordings and input logs, our method estimates the probability of each strategy and its parameters. Empirical studies demonstrate its application in designing animated transitions and predicting player scores in real-time games."
