summary: "This study identifies verbal and nonverbal behavioral indices of perceived social experience in virtual conversations. Analyzing turn-taking patterns and behavioral data from dyadic VR conversations, we find that rapid response time, longer speech and gaze duration, and increased nodding predict dynamic social experience changes. These findings offer objective, unobtrusive measures to enhance social VR interactions."
